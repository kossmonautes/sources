## Quick start
quoting kubernetes in action : It’s like learning to drive a car. You don’t want to know what’s under the hood. You first want to learn how to drive it from point A to point B. Only after you learn how to do that do you become interested in how a car makes that possible. After all, knowing what’s under the hood may someday help you get the car moving again after it breaks down and leaves you stranded at the side of the road
